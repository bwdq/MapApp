# MapApp

I needed to store the location of things I found on a map so I build this small application.

This small website uses leaflet.js to display a map and some map markers. It uses SQLite for persistence and Node.js/Express.js for the backend. It uses docker to package the application.

I built it after dooing the Docker tutorial. I wanted to be able to create portable standalone apps.
